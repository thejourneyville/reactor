- fixed bug which reset reaction speed to 0 if success shot was made after a collision
in the wrong direction during the duration of doors opening to closing

- added time marker to current_react_data to keep track of when shot was fired, is under the "success" or "fail" key
as index -1

- timer function is rounded to 2 decimal places (to track precise shot time)
and then reassigned as a whole number for the game timer

----- 8/3
- graph now plotting x(time) y(reaction speed) with color representation for direction

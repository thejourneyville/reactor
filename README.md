<h3>Using the arrow keys, launch the disc through the opening doors quickly! Focus and try to improve your reaction speed and accuracy!</h3>

<i>A training program which incorporates the Pygame library along with Sqlite to keep a database of current and past reaction and accuracy data. Created a GUI to enter your name which will persist in the database. You can use the mouse or keyboard to enter your name, inspired by 16bit RPGs. A lot of color shifting animation during game play, particles, a usage of deque to create a trailing effect of the disc and more!</i>
